/**
 * This type of model is created by parsing the manifest file.
 * It serves as a base interface for both plug-in and
 * fragment models by holding data common to both.
 * If the file is a workspace resource, it will be
 * available as the underlying resource of the model.
 * The model may be read-only or editable.
 * It will also make a reference to the build.properties
 * model when created. The reference will be of the
 * same type as the model itself: if the model is
 * editable, it will attempt to obtain an exclusive
 * editable copy of build.properties model.
 * <p>
 * The plug-in model can be disabled. Disabling the
 * model will not change its data. Users of the
 * model will have to decide if the disabled state
 * if of any importance to them or not.
 * <p>
 * The model is capable of notifying listeners
 * about changes. An attempt to change a read-only
 * model will result in a CoreException.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
